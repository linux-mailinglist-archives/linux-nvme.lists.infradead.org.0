I guess you mean we disable the interrupt in the softirq context.

IO performance could be affected by the extra action of disabling/enabling
interrupt every time.

IOPS for the discussed device is several millions.

blk-mq switches to complete req in interrupt context for avoiding extra
performance loss, so switching back to softirq context every time may
cause performance regression.

It can be hard to figure out one perfect defined budget.

In the patchset of V2[1], IRQF_ONESHOT is applied on the irq thread,
and interrupt isn't enabled until the interrupt has been handled in
the irq thread context.

[1] https://github.com/ming1/linux/commits/v5.3-genirq-for-5.4

The approach in this patchset is actually very similar with the above
NAPI based way. The difference is that softirq is avoided, and interrupt
is always handled in interrupt context in case that CPU won't be stalled,
so performance won't be affected. And we only switch to handle interrupt
in thread context if CPU stall is going to happen.

There isn't such CPU stall issue in case of single submission vs. single
completion, because submission side and completion side share same single
CPU, and the submission side will slow down if completion side takes all
the CPU.

Even though the threaded handler is RT priority and the thread is run
on same CPU with the interrupt, CPU/rcu stall still can be avoided.

Also we can switch to use irq affinity for the irq thread instead of effective
affinity.

Another big reason is that multiple submission vs. single completion isn't
common case, I knew that there are only small number of such device,
so re-inventing NAPI based approach may takes lots of effort, meantime
only small number of devices can get the benefit, not sure if block
community would like to consider that.

IMO, it might be the simplest generic way to solve the problem from genirq.
