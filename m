Agree - Nearly everything so far works in a fetch-once-in-order manner, 
but there's also nothing quoted that has great conviction. There's a lot 
of implications, especially with the word "next", but no hard 
requirement spelled out.

What I read that is more conclusive is.:

(4.1) "A Submission Queue entry has been consumed by the controller when 
a Completion Queue entry is posted that indicates that the Submission 
Queue Head Pointer has moved past the slot in which that Submission 
Queue entry was placed."
and
(4.1) "The controller uses the SQ Head Pointer (SQHD) field in 
Completion Queue entries to communicate new values of the Submission 
Queue Head Pointer to the host. A new SQHD value indicates that 
Submission Queue entries have been consumed, but does not indicate 
either execution or completion of any command."
and
(CQE SQHD description) "A Submission Queue entry has been consumed by 
the controller when a Completion Queue entry is posted that indicates 
that the Submission Queue Head Pointer has moved past the slot in which 
that Submission Queue entry was placed."

All of which say an SQE slot isn't consumed until the controller says so 
via a CQE with a SQHD pointer that says it's moved past the SQE slot. 
And it becomes absolutely necessary with a fabric and OOO SQE delivery.

Given there's some deviation in interpretation, it's likely a good thing 
to take up in the NVM Express group.
