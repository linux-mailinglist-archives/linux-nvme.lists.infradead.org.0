Indeed. I do not think that is special to ZNS at all.

I repeat again here: if you implement zone append emulation, there is no re=
ason
to reject devices that do not have zone append native support. Zone append
emulation gives you the block device, you can do ioctl(), implement the new
async passthrough and file systems requiring zone append work too. All prob=
lems
solved.
