The current LLDD api has:
  nvme-fc: contains api for transport to do LS requests (and aborts of
    them). However, there is no interface for reception of LS's and sending
    responses for them.
  nvmet-fc: contains api for transport to do reception of LS's and sending
    of responses for them. However, there is no interface for doing LS
    requests.

Revise the api's so that both nvme-fc and nvmet-fc can send LS's, as well
as receiving LS's and sending their responses.

Change name of the rcv_ls_req struct to better reflect generic use as
a context to used to send an ls rsp. Specifically:
  nvmefc_tgt_ls_req -> nvmefc_ls_rsp
  nvmefc_tgt_ls_req.nvmet_fc_private -> nvmefc_ls_rsp.nvme_fc_private

Change nvmet_fc_rcv_ls_req() calling sequence to provide handle that
can be used by transport in later LS request sequences for an association.

nvme-fc nvmet_fc nvme_fcloop:
  Revise to adapt to changed names in api header.
  Change calling sequence to nvmet_fc_rcv_ls_req() for hosthandle.
  Add stubs for new interfaces:
    host/fc.c: nvme_fc_rcv_ls_req()
    target/fc.c: nvmet_fc_invalidate_host()

lpfc:
  Revise to adapt code to changed names in api header.
  Change calling sequence to nvmet_fc_rcv_ls_req() for hosthandle.
