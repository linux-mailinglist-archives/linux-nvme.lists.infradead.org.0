With the patch, it's possible to process CQ on the CPU issuing I/O, effectively distributing the work to process CQ across multiple CPUs.

The original condition to trigger lockup is that multiple CPUs issuing I/O, and one CPU (where the HW queue will interrupt) processes CQ for all of them. With this patch and when I/O load is heavy, those issuing CPUs always have something to poll after I/O is issued. It's very difficult to overload the CPU that takes interrupts.

I have run tests for several days and couldn't repro the original lockup with the patch.
