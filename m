Doing (1) first will give you a regular nvme namespace block device that yo=
u can
use to send passthrough commands with ioctl(). So (1) gives you (2).

However, I do not understand what io-uring has to do with passthrough. io-u=
ring
being a block layer functionality, I do not think you can use it to send
passthrough commands to the driver. I amy be wrong though, but my understan=
ding
is that for NVMe, passthrough is either ioctl() to device file or the entire
driver in user space with SPDK.

As for (3), I do not understand your point. If you have (1), then an FS
requiring zone append will work.
